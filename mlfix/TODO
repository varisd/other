- generalize scenarios (language selection)
- improve NodeInfoGetter - use Alignment to determine parent/child relationships
- make statistics about old_node* -> new_node* category changes
	-> choose which categories we want to predict/change by classification

experimenting:
- multiple ScikitLearn models? (each predicting different subset of Iset classes)

two methods of evaluation:
- predicted categories - classification (model developement)
- BLEU
