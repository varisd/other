% Abstract (recommended length around 80-200 words; this is not a copy of your thesis assignment!)
\def\Abstract{%
We present MLFix, an automatic statistical post-editing system, which is a spiritual successor of the rule-based
system, Depfix. The aim of this thesis was to investigate the possible approaches to automatic identification
of the most common morphological errors produced by the state-of-the-art machine translation systems and
to train sufficient statistical models built on the acquired knowledge.
We performed both automatic and manual evaluation of the system and compared the results with Depfix. 
The system was mainly developed on the English-to-Czech
machine translation output, however, the aim was to generalize the post-editing process so it can be
applied to other language pairs. We modified the original pipeline to post-edit English-German machine
translation output and performed additional evaluation of this modification.
